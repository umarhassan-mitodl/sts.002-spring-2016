The essential goal of academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is using evidence to formulate an argument. One of the key tasks of this CI-H course is learning how to appropriately use evidence from primary and secondary sources. Properly citing your evidence is critical for several reasons. By showing the precise source of your evidence, your citations act as part of your argument. (Think of it like a court case: Your citations establish the "chain of custody" of the evidence you use). Further, your citations provide useful information for readers who might be interested in exploring the topic further. Finally, your citations show proper recognition to the work of previous scholars and help protect you from academic dishonesty (including plagiarism). Because proper citation is a major expectation of this assignment, you can expect to have your grade lowered if you fail to cite your evidence properly.

For all papers in this course, you are required to properly cite all evidence in your paper using "Chicago"-style footnotes. In general, you should provide citations whenever you:

*   Use a direct quotation from another source.
*   Paraphrase a statement or idea from another source.
*   Discuss, draw upon, or a debate an argument made in a secondary source.
*   Cite a piece of factual evidence that you have drawn from another source that is not "common knowledge." (In general, you should err on the side of caution: Unless you have come across a specific piece of evidence in multiple different sources, provide a citation!)

When using footnotes, you should cite your evidence by providing a superscript at the end of the sentence, after all relevant punctuation. The first time that you cite from a specific source in your paper, please provide a full citation for the source, following the guidelines below. Subsequently, you can use a short-form citation, consisting just of the author's last name, an abbreviated title, and the page number. For example: Chancellor, Devil, 38. For further information on citation practices, please see the [Chicago Manual of Style citation guide](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html).
